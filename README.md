# Mobile-Robot-Trolley-Using-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Based-Image-Processing
The supermarket trolley is used for carrying groceries while shopping and typically made of metal or plastic with wheels for easy movement. However, more items make it harder to push. To solve this, an automatic trolley was developed that follows hand gestures, reducing the need for manual pushing. Using Python and Mediapipe, it detects hand gestures to move forward, left, right, reverse, and stop, achieving 98% accuracy. A 2% failure rate occurred due to poor lighting conditions during testing.
